        <ol>
            <li>1. Invoice Genetor</li>
            <p>This Python code is an implementation of a simple INVOICE System using the Tkinter library for GUI,
                 MySQL for database management, and random for generating a bill number. The system includes a login page,
                  a billing page with the ability to add and generate bills, and a calculator for numerical calculations within th
                   application. The code utilizes object-oriented programming principles, creating classes for the login 
                   page and the billing page, with functions for various operations such as storing user information, checking login credentials, 
                   and handling billing details. The GUI design incorporates entry fields, buttons, and text areas for user interaction. The database 
                   is structured to store user credentials and is used for authentication during the login process. Overall, the system
                    provides a basic framework for an invoice management application with user authentication and billing functionalities. </p>
            <li>Water Level Controller </li>
            <p>This system mainly works on a principle that “water conducts electricity”. The four wires which are dipped into the tank will indicate the 
                different water levels. Based on the outputs of these wires, microcontroller displays water level on LCD as well as controls the motor.Initially when the tank is empty, LCD will display the message LOW and
                 motor runs automatically. When water level reaches to half level, now LCD displays HALF 
                and still motor runs.When the tank is full, LCD displays FULL and motor automatically stops. Again,
                 the motor runs when water level in the tank becomes LOW</p>
            <li>Unit Converter</li>
            <p>Project used thew concept of data structures as well as object oriented programming
                it was used to convert any given unit to any other given unit and give the output value to the customers
